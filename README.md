# POWER Engine

**POWER** stands for **Page Observer with Extraction & Route**.

POWER is a lightweight client-side runtime that observes navigation events,
extracts page templates, injects props, and routes content efficiently
without full page reloads.

Unlike virtual-DOM frameworks, POWER works directly with native DOM
fragments and page-scoped scripts for maximum control and performance.


## Features
- Declarative routing
- HTML template extraction
- Props interpolation
- Script sandboxing via Blob URLs
- Inline include system (HTML/CSS)
- Zero dependencies

## Why POWER?
Designed to optimize runtime performance by:
- Loading only required routes
- Executing page-scoped scripts
- Avoiding global re-renders

## Status
Experimental / Educational
